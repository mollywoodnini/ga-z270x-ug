As it currently stands, OpenCore is future of hackintosh going forward. However, Clover offers more stability. I do not plan on migrating to OpenCore on this hardware until it reaches a more stable level. If you wish to install macOS with ease on this hardware, you should remain on Mojave 10.14 when using my EFI as reference. I have had zero complications or instability. Which is why the repo has yet to be updated.
